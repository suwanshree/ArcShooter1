<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

ArcShooter1 lets players control a spaceship. The main objective of the game is to survive by not colliding with obstacles for as long as possible. More features such as the ability to shoot down enemy ships and enemy ships firing back at the player are currently a work in progress. Further game loops are also planned for future implementations. Launch executable is coming soon too! For now, to test the game in its current state please follow the steps in the setup section. Updates coming soon! Feedback is much appreciated!

## Key Features

- Players can boost the spaceship vertically to avoid obstacles
- Players can hold elevation and shoot at targets (WIP)
- Players only have a limited amount of boost and need to let go of controls to charge it back up (WIP)
- Distance travelled by players is printed on screen and high score is saved
- Game can be restarted when finished

   ```

3. From the application's root folder, in a terminal, launch the *main1.py* file using python:

   Windows:
   ```bash
   python main1.py
   ```

   MacOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 main1.py
   ```
